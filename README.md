### Project Bugs and Solutions:

Not a bug but I did realise I wanted to enable multiple categories to be applied to products when product model has already been made. So I changed model in separate branch and then merged branches. I had a problem after that so I had to clear all migrations to delete data and start all over again and make new migrations.
